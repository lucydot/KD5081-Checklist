Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the class checklist for KD5081. This checklist can be used to assess whether you have retained the Python programming skills introduced last year in KD4014.

If this is your first visit, you will need to get setup. Please see the student instructions [here](https://lucydot.github.io/ChooChoo/students/setup/).
